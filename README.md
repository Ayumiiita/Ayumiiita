<p align="center"> Hi there! ‚≠ê
  <br>
  My name's Laura and I'm passionate about technology, cats, and K-pop.
  <br>
  I've been doing a bit of coding lately, and I would love to <i>share it with all of you.</i>
  <br>
  This is my personal space where you'll find what I'm capable of.
  My strenghs are <b>Java, Python and Oracle Database</b>.
  <br>
  Anyway, I'll continue learning many more technologies so I can show you some really cool stuff. ü§©
